# Building Modern Web Applications with Go (Golang)


In this repository you can find the content that has been developed in each of the classes of the golang web development course created by Trevor Sawler

\>> https://www.udemy.com/course/building-modern-web-applications-with-go) \<<

The purpose of this repository is to facilitate the learning of this programming language by allowing you to navigate through the code that has been developed by browsing between committees and restoring the projects to the state in which they were in each of the lessons that are being developed in the corresponding course.

PS: If in the comit log you observe that there are jumps in the class, and that some of the classes are missing, do not worry that means that in that lesson no modifications have been made as such to the base code.
